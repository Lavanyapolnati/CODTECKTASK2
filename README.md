OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT TITLE:LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
To develop a comprehensive Library Management System in Java that supports books, magazines, and DVDs, and includes functionalities such as managing overdue fines, searching items, and supporting multiple user roles, we will implement a solution that integrates several features:

Item Management: Add new items (books, magazines, DVDs), check out, and return items.
Overdue Fines: Calculate and manage fines for overdue items.
Search Functionality: Search items by title, author, or category.
User Roles: Differentiate between librarians and patrons.
Data Persistence: Use file handling for simplicity (could be replaced with a database in a more complex system).
User Interface: Implement a simple console-based user interface for navigation.
In this program shows the output whatever the user need and list of books in the Library by using Java Language.
